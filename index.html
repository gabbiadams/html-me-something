                I'm currently learning the front-end side of web development.
                I've been learning JavaScript for a couple months now, and it's been really
                interesting, but finally putting it together with HTML and CSS is rewarding and 
                pretty fun. So far a few of my favorite projects have been:

                My husband and I moved to Northwest Arkansas in March of 2019. 
                It's an area we visited frequently when we lived in Oklahoma. We have both been 
                riding and racing bikes for a pretty long time, and the infrastructure for bikes
                and all other outdoor activities is pretty amazing in this area. We live in the middle of
                the Back 40 trail system, and spend lots of time riding awesome trail and scenic gravel roads.
                Here are just a few of my favorite areas to check out on the bike:
